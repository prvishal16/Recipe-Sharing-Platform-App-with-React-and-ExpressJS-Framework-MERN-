Recipe Sharing Platform App with React & ExpressJS (MERN)
This project is a full-stack recipe sharing platform where users can view, save, and share recipes. The application is built using React for the frontend and ExpressJS with Node.js for the backend. The database is powered by MongoDB to store recipe data and user information.

Features
User Authentication: Sign up, log in, and log out functionality.
Recipe Management: View, search, and save your favorite recipes.
Responsive Design: The app works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Real-time Data: Fetch data from the backend and dynamically render recipes.
Technologies Used
Frontend: ReactJS, Axios, CSS (for styling)
Backend: ExpressJS, Node.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and authentication
Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Recipe-Sharing-Platform-App-with-React-and-ExpressJS-Framework-MERN.git
cd Recipe-Sharing-Platform-App-with-React-and-ExpressJS-Framework-MERN
2. Set up the Backend (ExpressJS):
Navigate to the server directory:
bash
Copy code
cd server
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the server directory and add your MongoDB URI and JWT secret:
plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000 (by default).

3. Set up the Frontend (React):
Navigate to the client directory:
bash
Copy code
cd client
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React app:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000 (by default).
